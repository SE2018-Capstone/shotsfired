\section{Demo Summary}
\hspace*{5mm}
In this demo, we will demonstrate how our application works as whole. We will show
each part of the app and how it satisfies our two original user scenarios as
determined in Deliverable 1. The first user scenario was for a person to be able
to play with a group of friends. This would be done by allowing users to create
a private match in which they obtain a URL that their friends can use so that
everyone is entered in the same match. The second suer scenario was a for a person
to be able to play a game without friends. Here they would enter a Quick Play mode
and be entered in a lobby with random people. The game would start once the maximum
number of players have entered the lobby, or at least the minimum number of players
have entered the lobby and a time limit has been reached.\\

With respect to the first user scenario, a user is presented with a splash screen.
They then click the "Private Match" button to start a new private game that they
can play with friends. The first person to create the private match will be presented
with a screen that shows a URL that they can provide to their friends.
WILL UPDATE ONCE FUNCTIONALITY CONFIRMED


\section{Status Report - TO CHANGE}
\hspace*{5mm}
Currently, we have the functionality of the actual character game play completed. There
is a basic splash screen at the moment with an option to ``Quick Play". This is
used for the user to join a game without friends. The functionality for joining
a non-friend game is complete such that a game starts when there are at least
two people and a time limit has been reached, or four people have joined.\\

In addition to this, we need to create a button to ``Play with Friends". Within
this, a user would be able to create a private group. Users will be able to
join this private group by entering a URL or entering a code within the ``Play
with Friends" option.\\

Within the gameplay, when there is only one player left, the game is over, and an appropriate screen
will have to be displayed for the user indicating that the user has won or that
the game is over. From there, there will be a button that will take the user
back to the main menu / splash screen. If it is a game with a group of friends,
there will be an option to play another game with the some people.\\

In terms of difficulties we've encountered, they have been server related issues.
Right now, unless the server is funning at 60 FPS, the player movement of non-user controlled characters will be choppy and delayed.
This will have to be improved so that all player movement is smooth.
We are also experiencing some syncing issues between the client and server.
In the prototype demo, the server runs at such a speed that this is not noticeable,
however we will need to do something to fix these issues so that there is no delay in events and actions between the client(s) and server.
