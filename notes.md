# Core Logic Details

- Server

  - Each frame, get a snapshot of user inputs

  - At some frequency, send frames to server, with timestamps of how long each frame took.

  - Server has a buffer of input frames for each player, as long as theres stuff in the buffer it runs it.  

    - Server runs the game loop, but the delta time it uses is the input it got
